Run javascript in the envirment dont need brower/engine for running
like chrome use the engine v8 


npm

-- How to create server in nodejs 

first require nodejs prebuild package http

const http = require('http');
then we need to use the http server property 
const server = http.createServer((req , res)=>{




});


This take two param req and res
req by the user
res send by the app or server through 


now server created run now to run

server.listen(port , ()=>{
    console.log("The server is running on port" )
});



// module


thay are like transfer the file code from one page to another 
if you see when we require/import  a package that mean we are using module
you can also create your own module and transfer it 


how to create module

file one 
sum.js

const sum (a , b)=>{
return a +  b ;
}

we can transfer it two way 
by using module.exports = sum
or exports defult sum  

but we will focus on exports and import 
you can now exports this sum file many way 
1 - exports default sum    this mean in exports file you can give any name to it 
2 - exports {sum}  that mean in exports file you can not give any name to it you just need to import the same name
or 
3 - you can also import file with code at same time
import sum(a , b)=>{
return a +b 
}
4- you can import many file at same time
import {sum , div}


secound file the take the import file

you can write 
export sum from "your module_location"
export sum from "./sum.js"


note: in import and export you need to add the "type": "module" in package.json file 
then this will work
