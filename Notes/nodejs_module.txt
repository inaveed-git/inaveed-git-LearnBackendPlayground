nodejs


that use javascript to run it out side the brower 
Run javascript in the envirment dont need brower/engine for running
like chrome use the engine v8 


npm 

that is a package or a pre writen code by developer to other developer to use it.
we need to require/import the npm after install
-- how to install --
in the terminal we write 
npm i npm_Name or npm install npm_Name



-- How to create server in nodejs 

first require nodejs prebuild package http

const http = require('http');
then we need to use the http server property 
const server = http.createServer((req , res)=>{




});


This take two param req and res
req by the user
res send by the app or server through 


now server created run now to run

server.listen(port , ()=>{
    console.log("The server is running on port" )
});



// module


thay are like transfer the file code from one page to another 
if you see when we require/import  a package that mean we are using module
you can also create your own module and transfer it 


how to create module

file one 
sum.js

const sum (a , b)=>{
return a +  b ;
}

we can transfer it two way 
by using module.exports = sum
or exports defult sum  

but we will focus on exports and import 
you can now exports this sum file many way 
1 - exports default sum    this mean in exports file you can give any name to it 
2 - exports {sum}  that mean in exports file you can not give any name to it you just need to import the same name
or 
3 - you can also import file with code at same time
import sum(a , b)=>{
return a +b 
}
4- you can import many file at same time
import {sum , div}


secound file the take the import file

you can write 
export sum from "your module_location"
export sum from "./sum.js"


note: in import and export you need to add the "type": "module" in package.json file 
then this will work 



Fs module 

this module help us to read , write and delete files 
in this fs file mangement system you can create update delete file in the way of 
async and sync way 

async is void can not return value
sync is not void can return value


import fs from 'fs'


and async always take the callback 
bt sync dont take callback

fs.writeFile('fileLocation' , 'data in that file' , ((err)=>{}) );
fs.writeFileAysnc('fileLocation' , 'data in the file');

writeFile/writeFileAysnc use to create file

fs.readFile('fileLocation' , 'decoding type'  , ((err , res)=>{
    if(err){
        console.log(err)
    }else{
        console.log(res)
    }
}))
decoding type = how you gona see the file in which way  == 'Utf-8'

fs.readFileAsync('fileLocation' , 'decoding type' )


readFile and readFileAsync is used to readTheFile that have beeen saved


fs.append('fileLocation' , 'adding data' , ((err)=>{

}))
fs.appendAsync('fileLocation' , 'adding data' )

append and appendAsync is used for to add the data to exist file that has located  not override data like writeFile


fs.unlinkSync("fileLocation")
fs.unlink("fileLocation" , callback())


unlink and unlinkSync use for to delete the file 

PATH module

this module work with path of the folder and file
this module give address/location/extension and many more

import path form 'path'

path.join("c:\\" , "program\\vide.mp4");

output:  c:\program\vide.mp4
this path.join is used for to join to path 


path.dirname()
this path.dirname is used for absloute path mean give the location of file where it located
give the location of file where it is located

path.extname("c:\\program\\video.mp4")
this path.extname use for give the extension of file 
like here the extension is mp4
